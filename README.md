**` (Developer/Creator)`**

I am a developer from the Informatics Engineering study program at Dian Nuswantoro University with experience in research-based technology, particularly in Android and web development. I also possess skills in data processing using Microsoft Office tools. I am currently seeking new opportunities and experiences in a good work environment to continue my growth and learning journey, and to further enhance my skills. I am enthusiastic about contributing to the technology industry through innovation.
I have the ability to work effectively within a team, manage time efficiently, communicate well, and excel in problem-solving.

In the past, my GitHub account was under the username "aadityaanugrah10"; however, it got suspended, which led me to create a new GitHub account.
